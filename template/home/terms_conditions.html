            <h4 class="mb-2 mt-2">Sales Terms & Conditions</h4>
            <p>
                The following terms and conditions (the “Terms”) apply to all purchases made on  
                <a href="https://regionesicilianait.com">regionesicilianait.com</a>. By placing an order you make an offer to  
                <strong>Regione Siciliana</strong> (“we/us/our”). That offer is accepted when we process your order and dispatch  
                the items, creating a binding agreement between you and us.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please read these Terms carefully before placing your order. They do not affect your statutory rights.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mb-2 mt-2">Acknowledgment and Receipt of Orders</h4>
            <p>
                Orders are acknowledged by email as soon as possible. Any acknowledgment does not constitute our legal  
                acceptance; acceptance occurs only when we process and dispatch your items.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will email you a copy of your receipt (either separately or within the acknowledgment). The receipt confirms  
                we have received your payment authorization and serves as proof of purchase for any returns—please retain it.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mb-2 mt-2">Availability</h4>
            <p>
                All orders are subject to availability. If an item is unavailable, we will notify you and refund any payment made  
                for that item. Only one special offer may be redeemed per order and per household.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mb-2 mt-2">14-Day Returns – Your Statutory Rights</h4>
            <p>
                To return items under your statutory rights, notify us within 14 days of receipt. You then have an additional  
                14 days to return the items (28 days total). We will refund the cost of the items and standard return postage.  
                Deductions may apply if items are not returned “as new,” or if promotional items are missing.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mb-2 mt-2">12-Month Guarantee</h4>
            <p>
                In addition to statutory rights, any item developing a fault within 12 months of delivery will be repaired or  
                replaced free of charge, provided:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The fault arises from normal domestic use;</li>
                <li>Normal wear and tear is excluded;</li>
                <li>No unauthorized repairs have been made (this invalidates the guarantee).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Clearance items uneconomical to repair may, at our discretion, be refunded pro-rata.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mb-2 mt-2">Payment and Prices</h4>
            <p>
                All prices are as shown on the Site when you place your order. Once you order, prices are locked in. Errors will  
                be corrected, and you’ll have the option to proceed at the correct price.
            </p>
            <p>
                We accept payment by Bank Wire/Swift or direct bank transfer. Cheques and cash on delivery are not accepted.  
                All prices are in € (EUR), inclusive of VAT but excluding delivery charges, which are shown at checkout.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mb-2 mt-2">Delivery</h4>
            <p>
                We deliver worldwide. Delivery times shown in our Purchase Procedure are estimates only; time is not of the essence.  
                If delivery is delayed more than 7 working days beyond the estimated date, you may cancel for a full refund.
            </p>
            <p>
                Title passes on delivery. Please inspect items immediately; you’re responsible for them once the carrier attempts  
                delivery and obtains your signature.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mb-2 mt-2">Liability</h4>
            <p>
                We use reasonable care in descriptions but cannot guarantee all specifications remain current. If items fail to  
                match the description at purchase, we will collect and refund you upon proof of purchase.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are not liable for delays or failures caused by events beyond our control (force majeure), nor for any indirect  
                or consequential losses.
            </p>

            <h4 class="mb-2 mt-2">Complaint Procedure</h4>
